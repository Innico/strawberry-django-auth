## About

Abstract all the basic logic of handling user accounts out of your app,
so you don't need to think about it and can ==get you up and running faster==.

your implementation^^.

## Example

Handling user accounts becomes super easy.

```python
mutation {
  register(
    email: "new_user@email.com",
    username: "new_user",
    password1: "123456super",
    password2: "123456super",
  ) {
    success,
    errors,
    token,
    refreshToken
  }
}
```

Check the status of the new user:

```python
u = UserModel.objects.last()
u.status.verified
# False
```

During the registration, an email with a verification link was sent.

```python
mutation {
  verifyAccount(
    token:"<TOKEN ON EMAIL LINK>",
  ) {
    success,
    errors
  }
}
```

Now user is verified.

```python
u.status.verified
# True
```
